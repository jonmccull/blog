summary: 'Raycast AI writes a review of Raycast'

For awhile now I've been hearing the name [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) floating around. What was it? I wasn't sure. A tech do-dad. A word whispering around my internet bubble, but never quite making it to my prefrontal cortex. You know, one of those things.

Last week, one of these interweb whispers caught my attention because apparently Todoist [integrates](https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/raycast) with Raycast. And apparently it's pretty cool. And I work at Doist, who makes [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home). So here I was, installing Raycast to see what all the fuss was about and wouldn't you know it - it *is* pretty cool.

I'd love to go into more depth about all of the brilliant things Raycast does right as a launcher. Because...it's a lot. For now though, I just wanted to share an example output from working with Raycast AI in the chat interface.

Raycast's LLM Chat interface lets you run multiple, specialized chats simultaneously.

Now, just to be clear, *this* is me writing. This is Jon. But *below* is a review of Raycast, written entirely by Raycast AI. It's not the initial output, but not far from it. I spent all of 10 minutes iterating and tweaking using a set of instructions I'd grabbed for a "Pro Writer" GPT.

So, with that, here is Raycast as reviewed by Raycast AI.

Raycast had me hooked from the first interaction. What initially seemed like another Spotlight alternative quickly revealed itself as a multifaceted productivity companion.

At its core, Raycast simplifies accessing the apps and tools you rely on daily. With extensions for Todoist, GitHub, and more, you can interact with these services through a few keystrokes - no window-hopping required. It's like having a command center for your digital life (minus the mission control room chaos).

Then there's the window management feature, which admittedly had me skeptical at first. Keyboard shortcuts for resizing and repositioning windows? Revolutionary, or just another gimmick? After giving it a try, I was sold. No more dragging windows around like a caveman - just a few taps, and your workspace is purposefully organized.

But Raycast's potential really shines with its integrated AI assistant. Need to quickly lookup information or generate some content? No problem, just engage the AI right there in the app. And for all you skeptics out there, Raycast lets you steer the AI conversation for tailored, high-quality results (no generic robot rambling here).

Perhaps the biggest draw though is Raycast's flexibility. The active community continuously expands the app's capabilities through extensions, themes and more. You can sculpt Raycast into your ideal productivity tool without any unnecessary bloat weighing you down.

Is Raycast a perfect, flawless solution? Of course not. But it's a remarkably clever utility that streamlines your digital workflow in meaningful ways. If you're looking to up your productivity game without jumping through hoops, give Raycast an honest try. You might just find yourself a new digital sidekick.
