# Things to cover

## Discovering Raycast
- What is it? Described as a macOS launcher, but...

## Keyboard ftw
What does your phone’s home screen look like? Do you actually use app folders to find things? 

I’ve always been a more keyboard/text-based kinda guy when it comes to launching and finding things on my laptop. But this also goes for my phone. If Apple’s screen time data is anything to go by, around 500 times a week I pickup my phone (>70 times a day). And if I had to guess, I’d say about 50 of those are to swipe down and open the search field, where I’ll use shorthand app names to get where I need to go.

Back on my MacBook, it’s much the same. if I need to find something, nine times out of ten I’ll bring up the Spotlight search, mash a few keys, and hit Enter.

All this to say: text-based call-ups are my jam.

### Window Management
The more “what’s in my Raycast” videos I watch, the more it seems like I may have missed the boat on Alfred. Nearly every guest (or Raycast team member) mentions how critical Alfred has been to them over the years.
