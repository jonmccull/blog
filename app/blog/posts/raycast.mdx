I've been hearing the name [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) floating around for awhile now. What was it? I wasn't sure. Just another tech do-dad. A word whispering around my internet bubble, but never quite making it to my prefrontal cortex. You know. One of those things.

Last week one of these interweb whispers caught my attention because apparently Todoist [integrates](https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/raycast) with Raycast. And apparently it's pretty cool. And I work at Doist[^1], who makes [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home). So here I was, installing Raycast to see what all the fuss was about and wouldn't you know it - it *is* pretty cool.

## So, go on then. What *is* Raycast?
I've seen Raycast described as a "macOS launcher". Or just referred to as a (*much* better) replacement for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), another mysterious tool I somehow know about through the magic of "[Dark Social](https://buffer.com/resources/dark-social/)" 👻[^2][^3].

[^2]: "Dark social, a term coined by Alexis C. Madrigal in [a 2012 article for The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/), refers to the social sharing of content that occurs outside of what can be measured by web analytics." - [Buffer](https://buffer.com/resources/dark-social/)

[^3] Alfred also, objectively, has one of the most annoying logos in tech. A top hat with a magnifying glass? Come on.

I suppose you have to categorize it somehow, but "a launcher" doesn't quite get there. The core interaction with Raycast is very much like Spotlight Search on macOS. You start typing, results appear (including apps, files, suggested searches, etc). But that's where the similarities end.

It's not that I think Spotlight is terrible. My muscle memory for using Spotlight to launch apps goes deep. But in Raycast, this workflow (if you can call it that) feels almost antiquated.

## Keyboard ftw
Putting aside Raycast for a second. What does your phone’s home screen look like? Do you actually use app folders to find things, or know where all of your apps icons are on the screen? This might just be the litmus test for whether you should keep reading. 

If Apple’s screen time data is anything to go by, around 500 times a week I pickup my phone (>70 times *a day* 😳). And if I had to guess, I’d say about 50 pickups go like this: unlock, swipe down to open Search, type shorthand app names ("I" for Instagram, "Ma" for Mail), and tap `Enter` to open the first result.[^4]

[^4]: The trigger for this way of using my phone was reading [How to Unhijack Your Mind from Your Phone](https://medium.com/thrive-global/distracted-in-2016-reboot-your-phone-with-mindfulness-9f4c8ad46538) by Tristin Harris. In the section called "Use your iPhone’s Consciousness Filter (Typing)".   

[screen cap iOS search to open Insta, NYT, Mail…]

And on my laptop? Much the same. My thumbs are always poised to hit Command + Space, and my left-hand ring finger lives on Tab, ready to jump between open apps.



Back on my MacBook, it’s much the same. if I need to find something, nine times out of ten I’ll bring up the Spotlight search, mash a few keys, and hit Enter.

All this to say: text-based call-ups are my jam.

The more “what’s in my Raycast” videos I watch, the more it seems like I may have missed the boat on Alfred. Nearly every guest (or Raycast team member) mentions how critical Alfred has been to them over the years.
