summary: 'Launching the beta version of Ask, an AI assistant for team knowledge.'
---

## Overview
[Ask](https://slite.com/ask) is an AI assistant for team knowledge built by Slite. In early 2023, the team launched the first version of Ask in closed beta.

The aims of the launch were to drive signups to the beta, build brand awareness and positionâ†— Slite as an innovator in the collaborative workspace category; being first-to-market with an AI solutionâ€“built uniquely for the team knowledge management context.

## Approach
With the early working alpha ready, we set a deadline of two weeks to prepare, build and launch the initial beta of Ask while the feature was finalized. The short deadline reflected the urgency, given how fast new AI-enabled tools were emerging at the time.

We focused heavily on [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com/) as the main communication channel, with a launch-day goal of being Product of the Day.
