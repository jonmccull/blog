I'd been hearing the name [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) floating around for awhile now. What was it? I wasn't sure. A tech do-dad. A word whispering around my internet bubble, but never quite making it to my prefrontal cortex. You know. One of those things.

Last week one of these interweb whispers caught my attention because apparently Todoist [integrates](https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/raycast) with Raycast. And apparently it's pretty cool. And I work at Doist[^1], who makes [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home). So here I was, installing Raycast to see what all the fuss was about and wouldn't you know it - it *is* pretty cool.

[^1]: I was going to say "apparently" here too, but that made me sound like a jerk.

## So, go on then. What *is* Raycast?
Raycast is usually described as a "macOS launcher". Or just referred to as "a (*much* better) replacement for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)", another mysterious tool I somehow know about through the magic of "[Dark Social](https://buffer.com/resources/dark-social/)" üëª.[^2]

[^2]: "Dark social, a term coined by Alexis C. Madrigal in [a 2012 article for The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/), refers to the social sharing of content that occurs outside of what can be measured by web analytics." - [Buffer](https://buffer.com/resources/dark-social/)

I suppose you have to categorize it somehow, but "a launcher" doesn't quite do it justice. The core interaction with Raycast is very much like Spotlight Search on macOS. You start typing, results appear (including apps, files, suggested searches, basic calculations, etc). But that's where the similarities end.

It's not that I think Spotlight is terrible. My muscle memory for using Spotlight to launch apps goes deep. But in Raycast, this workflow (if you can call it that) feels almost antiquated.

## Keyboard ftw
Putting aside Raycast for a second. What does your phone‚Äôs home screen look like? Do you actually use app folders to find things, or know where all of your apps icons are on the screen? This might just be the litmus test for whether you should keep reading.

If Apple‚Äôs screen time data is anything to go by, around 500 times a week I pickup my phone (>70 times *a day* üò≥). And if I had to guess, I‚Äôd say about 50 pickups go like this: unlock, swipe down to open Search, type shorthand app names ("I" for Instagram, "Ma" for Mail), and tap `Enter` to open the first result.[^3]

[^3]: The trigger for this way of using my phone was reading [How to Unhijack Your Mind from Your Phone](https://medium.com/thrive-global/distracted-in-2016-reboot-your-phone-with-mindfulness-9f4c8ad46538) by Tristin Harris. In the section called "Use your iPhone‚Äôs Consciousness Filter (Typing)".   

[screen cap iOS search to open Insta, NYT, Mail‚Ä¶]

And on my laptop? Much the same. My thumbs sit on `‚åò` + `Space`, and my left-hand ring finger lives on `Tab` (to trigger the Application Switcher and jump between apps). Most of the time I'm bouncing between maybe 3 or 4 apps using `‚åò + Tab`. If I need to find or launch something, I use Spotlight Search (`‚åò + Space`).

All this to say: text-based call-ups are my jam.

## Hotkey thinking

### Hyper Key 
A new-to-me hack that I found while browsing around some Raycast tutorials was the "Hyper Key". Basically, it means using a custom keyboard mapping to make a single key on your keyboard register as a combination of modifier keys being pressed at the same time (`‚åò + Control + option + Shift`). This opens up a new set of shortcuts, without the finger yoga.

### Window Management
The more ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in my Raycast‚Äù videos I watch, the more it seems like I may have missed the boat on Alfred. Nearly every guest (or Raycast team member) mentions how critical Alfred has been to them over the years.
