        {`Hi there, I'm Jon ðŸ‘‹, a marketer that loves working on bringing great products to market and keeping them there.
          
          Over the past ten or so years Iâ€™ve taken a journey through different corners of marketing. Early experience in editorial, content, and growth marketing led me to the niche where I plant my flag today: product marketing.
          
          Why product marketing? Because Iâ€™m a geek at heart. I love being close to the creation of a thing. And  see how that thing gets introduced, embraced, and maybe even loved by millions of people.
          
          Right now Iâ€™m a Product Marketer at Doist, working on taking a market-leading todo list  app, Todoist, to the next level.
          
          I work remotely from my home in Haugesund, on the west coast of Norway.
