    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://slite.com/ask">Ask</a> is an AI assistant for team knowledge built by Slite.
      In early 2023, the team launched the first version of Ask in closed beta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aims of the launch were to drive signups to the beta, build brand awareness and position
      Slite as an innovator in the collaborative workspace category; being first-to-market with an
      AI solution–built uniquely for the team knowledge management context.
    </p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      With the early working alpha ready, we set a deadline of two weeks to prepare, build and
      launch the initial beta of Ask while the feature was finalized. The short deadline reflected
      the urgency, given how fast new AI-enabled tools were emerging at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focused heavily on <a href="https://producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> as the main
      communication channel, with a launch-day goal of being Product of the Day.
