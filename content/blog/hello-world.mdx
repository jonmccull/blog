# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog! This is a test post to demonstrate the MDX functionality and various features of the blog system.

## Features

- MDX Support
- Reading Time Estimation
- RSS Feed
- Optimized Images
- Dark Mode Support

## Using Images

Here's an example of how to use the optimized image component:

```tsx
import Image from '@/components/Image'

;<Image
  src="/images/example.jpg"
  alt="Example image"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  caption="This is an example image with a caption"
/>
```

## Code Highlighting

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('World'))
```

## What's Next?
