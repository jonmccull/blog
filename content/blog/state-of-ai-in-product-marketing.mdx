Last week [Yi Lin Pei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yilinpei/) dropped a must-read report for anyone wrestling with the future of Product Marketing in the age of AI. ðŸ‘€

[The 2025 State of AI in Product Marketing Report](https://www.courageous-careers.com/ai-in-product-marketing-report) is full of honest insights, real-world examples, and practical tips from 200+ PMMs navigating AI in the field right now (including yours truly ðŸ‘‹).

Reading through the responses from so many peers, I found myself nodding along and feeling reassured.

AI is time-saving. Itâ€™s a brilliant co-pilot. But itâ€™s definitely not a replacement for human judgment or understanding the fundamentals of your craft.

ðŸ§  One takeaway that stuck with me:

> Stay rooted in strategy, empathy, and stakeholder management.

Thatâ€™s the kind of PMM work AI canâ€™t touch, and where our real value lies.

Huge thanks again to Yi Lin for putting this together. Itâ€™s a powerful thing to get a clear picture of how your discipline is evolving and how your peers are adapting.
