Marketers love a good framework. But there’s really only one you need. GACC.

At the start of any project there are a handful of fundamental factors you need a handle on:

- **G**oals → what are we trying to do?
- **A**udience → who are we talking to?
- **C**reative angle → what’s our unique angle?
- **C**hannels → where will our audience experience it? 

Understanding the answers to these questions clarifies the intention and direction of any marketing activity, big or small. It roots your thinking in outcomes and directs your focus to creating something interesting for the people you want to talk to. 

It’s amazingly simple, but super powerful.

Writing a newsletter? GACC it. Building a paid campaign? GACC. Moving upmarket and introducing a kicking off a new growth motion? GACC.

Give it a try on your next project and see where it takes you.
